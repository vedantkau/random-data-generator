# Random data generator


We require the dummy data when we start working on data pipeline with new logic or develop new app or learn and test new data tools, in such cases this tool may be helpful. You can generate random data with specific nature mimicking near real world data.

In the web version, there are restrictions on size of data to be generated. To remove these restrictions, the docker version that can be hosted locally will be available soon.
