# Random data generator


We require a testing data when we are working on data pipeline or develop new app or learn and test new data tools, in such scenarios this tool can provide required dummy data. You can generate random data of specific nature mimicking real world data as closely as possible.

In web version, there are limitations on size of data to be generated. To use this tool with no limits, pull the docker version from dockerhub,
`docker pull vedantkau/random-datagen-webapp:no_limits`

Checkout the webapp at [Random data generator](https://random-data-generator.streamlitapp.com/). Thanks to streamlit framework and community cloud that helped this development!
