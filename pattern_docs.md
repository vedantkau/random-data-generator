##### Pattern types
- __min_max:__
  Available for integer, decimal and date datatypes.

  Define min value and max value. Random data will be generated between and including these values. 
  
  For integer and decimal datatype, even if values are given in decimal, those will be converted into integers. For date datatype, values will be defined in date format.

- __range:__
  Available for integer, decimal and date datatypes.

  Define min and increment value. Series of data will be generated starting from min value and incrementing by increment value. 
  
  For integer datatype, if min and increment values are given in decimal, those will be converted into integers. For decimal datatype, only min value will be converted to integer. For date datatype, min value will be taken in date format and increment value will be converted to integer.

- __list:__
  Available for all datatypes.

  Data will be generated by selecting elements from list randomly. List can be defined by defining all its elements separated by comma (,). Example- For list "A,B,C", data will be generated by selecting A, B and C elements randomly.

  For bool datatype, if no. of elements defined are more than 2 then only first 2 elements will be taken to generate data. Max 20 elements can be added in a list and length of each list element must be less than 30.

- __expression:__
  Availble only for string datatype.

  Data will be generated based on expression defined.

  Expression syntax:

  `(random_letters:a,b)[element1,element2,element3]`
  
  - () - Everything inside these braces will be selected randomly.
  - [] - Everything inside these braces is considered as a list similar to above list pattern type.
  - :a,b - This will define the length of word to be generated. If a=1, b=3 then length of word will be between 1 and 3.
  - :a - This will define the length of word to be generated is a. If a=1 then length of word will be 1.
  - The characters - `:, (, ), [, ], \`  must be escaped using (\) character.

  Special tokens:
  - \ul: Select random letter from A-B.
  - \ll: Select random letter from a-b.
  - \l: Select random letter from A-Ba-b.
  - \d: select random letter from 0-9.

  Very specific words can be generated by combining several () and [] expressions.

  Examples:
  - To generate email IDs the expression to use is - `(\ul:1)(\ll:5,7)(.:1)(\ll:3,5)[@gmail.com,@hotmail.com,@yahoo.com]`. Data will look like this,

    | # | Email IDs |
    |---|-----------|
    | 0 | Sdaqkizf.ghq@yahoo.com |
    | 1 | Awmtepfa.xqyxl@gmail.com |
    | 2 | Gwurluu.ixz@gmail.com |
    | 3 | Bizxixi.aphew@hotmail.com |
    | 4 | Zaayxrla.nvzq@gmail.com |
  - To generate phone numbers the expression to use is - `[+91](-:1)(123:3)(\d:9)`. Data will look like this,

    | # | Phone |
    |---|-----------|
    | 0 | +91-2586847418 |
    | 1 | +91-3111813323 |
    | 2 | +91-2610339551 |
    | 3 | +91-2677296952 |
    | 4 | +91-2762165190 |
  - To generate data with characters `:, (, ), [, ], \` the expression to use is - `(\:\(\):2,3)`. Data will look like this,

    | # | Escape chars |
    |---|-----------|
    | 0 | (:: |
    | 1 | :( |
    | 2 | )( |
    | 3 | (( |
    | 4 | )( |
